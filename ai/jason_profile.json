  "what_im_looking_for": "I'm looking for a software engineering role where I can keep growing technically, work on meaningful problems, and contribute to a team that values quality and collaboration. I'm open to backend, frontend, or full-stack roles. I thrive in environments where I can learn from senior engineers and take on increasing responsibility.",

  "personality_notes": "I'm a hard worker who takes pride in what I build. I went the non-traditional route — bootcamp instead of a CS degree — and I've worked to prove myself every step of the way. I like going deep on problems and building things that are polished, not just functional. Outside of work, I'm always tinkering with side projects to learn new technologies."
